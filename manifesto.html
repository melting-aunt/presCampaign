        <p>The manifesto of Lord President Sir Louis de Pol, First of His Name, Manifester of -Os, was inspired by a number of good-for-their-time-but-really-could-do-with-being-brought-into-the-21st-century-a-bit books, such as George Orwell's 1984, The Green Book by Muammar Gaddafi, and Mr Silly, by the Great Revolutionary Comrade Roger 'Che' Hargreaves.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="quotes">"Look, Mark, I'm a musician, in case you've forgotten. I answer to a higher law, the law of "If it feels good, do it" ... It's the musician's law. Colonel Gaddafi could not lay down a bass hook, Mark. That should be clear even to you."

        <p>Among the policies I would introduce would be that everyone must be prosperous. This is because I have promised to bring about prosperity, but I'm not going to do it for you, I'm not your dad. I would also change the national anthem, because quite frankly the Star Spangled Banner is crap. Evidence of this can be seen at major sporting events - where every other national anthem is sung with pride, Americans never join in, which defeats the point of an anthem in the first place as being a song everyone knows the words to and can sing. So, it will now be 'Easy' by the Commodores, because I've been listening to it a lot lately and it fucking slaps. Finally, I would decriminalise insurance fraud, because it is my main source of income and I don't want to go to prison.</p>
